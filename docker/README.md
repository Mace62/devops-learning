# Docker Learning

This repository contains my learning journey with Docker, including basic Docker concepts and a multi-container application challenge.

## Directory Structure

### `hello_flask/`
This directory contains my initial Docker learning materials. I used this to learn basic Docker concepts including:
- Creating Dockerfiles
- Using docker-compose
- Connecting containers (Flask app with MySQL)
- Multi-stage builds
- Container networking

### `challenge 1/containers-intro/challenge/`
This directory contains my attempt at the containers-intro challenge. The challenge involves:
- Building a multi-container application with Flask and Redis
- Implementing persistent storage for Redis
- Using environment variables for configuration
- Scaling the application with load balancing

## Getting Started

### hello_flask
Navigate to the `hello_flask/` directory and use docker-compose to run the application.

### Challenge 1
Navigate to `challenge 1/containers-intro/challenge/` and follow the instructions in the README.md file.
